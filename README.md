# Ada-Regex
A simple regular expression library for Ada applications

The implementation of this library closely follows the algorithms provided in the famous Dragon Book.

To build the library and tests, run `gprbuild -p regex-tests.gpr`. If you only want to build the library,
run `gprbuild -p regex.gpr`.

Take a look at the Regex.Matchers package if you want to use the library for anything useful.
